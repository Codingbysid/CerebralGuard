## üß† Vision

CerebralGuard is an autonomous, multi-step AI agent designed to automate the detection, analysis, and response to email-based phishing threats. In a world where phishing attacks are increasingly sophisticated, CerebralGuard acts as a force multiplier for security teams and provides an essential defensive layer for organizations lacking dedicated cybersecurity staff.

Our vision is to create a self-improving security agent that not only identifies threats with high accuracy but also learns from every interaction, building a unique, organization-specific threat intelligence database.

## üéØ The Problem

Phishing remains the #1 entry vector for cyberattacks. Security teams are overwhelmed by the volume of suspicious emails reported by employees, leading to:

- **Analyst Burnout**: Manually analyzing hundreds of similar emails is tedious and inefficient
- **Slow Response Times**: The delay between a report and an analysis can be the window an attacker needs to succeed
- **Inconsistent Analysis**: Different analysts may come to different conclusions based on the same evidence
- **Resource Scarcity**: Small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) often lack the budget or personnel to manage a phishing triage program effectively

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

CerebralGuard implements a sophisticated multi-step agentic workflow:

### Step 1: Ingest & Parse (Data Ingestion)
- Email listener service picks up new emails
- Gemini API parses raw email (.eml file), including headers, body, and attachments
- Extracts key Indicators of Compromise (IOCs): URLs, domains, sender IP address, email addresses, and attachment file hashes

### Step 2: Dual-Threat Search (Database Search)
- Connects to TiDB Serverless instance
- **Vector Search**: Email body converted to vector embedding, queried for semantically similar emails
- **Full-Text Search**: Extracted IOCs used for precise, full-text search against database

### Step 3: External Reputation Check (External Tool Invocation)
- Uses extracted IOCs to query external APIs for real-time reputation data
- **VirusTotal API**: Check reputation of URLs, domains, and file hashes
- **AbuseIPDB API**: Check reputation of sender's IP address

### Step 4: In-House AI Analysis (Custom ML Model)
- Full, cleaned text passed to custom-trained machine learning model
- Provides phishing probability score based on deep textual patterns learned from training data
- Acts as independent verification step

### Step 5: Synthesize & Decide (LLM Chaining)
- All collected evidence compiled into single context prompt
- Final call to Gemini API with comprehensive prompt
- LLM acts as "Senior Security Analyst," reviews all evidence, provides final verdict

### Step 6: Act & Learn (Automated Action & Feedback Loop)
- **Malicious**: Send high-priority alert to security Slack channel, block sender/domain
- **Suspicious**: Create ticket in Jira for human review
- **Safe**: Automatically reply to reporting employee, confirm email is safe
- **Learn**: Entire analysis vectorized and logged in TiDB Serverless database

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Database**: TiDB Serverless (for vector and full-text search)
- **AI / LLM**: Google Gemini API
- **In-House AI**: Python, PyTorch, BERT-based transformer model
- **External APIs**: VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, Slack
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI)
- **Email Handling**: Python imaplib

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- TiDB Serverless account
- Google Gemini API key
- VirusTotal API key (optional)
- Slack webhook URL (optional)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd cerebralguard
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys and configuration
   ```

4. **Initialize the database**
   ```bash
   python -c "from db.tidb_helpers import tidb_manager; tidb_manager.initialize_database()"
   ```

5. **Start the application**
   ```bash

## üìä API Endpoints

### Core Endpoints

- `GET /` - API information and available endpoints
- `GET /health` - System health check
- `POST /process-email` - Process a suspicious email through the complete workflow
- `GET /statistics` - Get processing statistics
- `GET /model-status` - Check status of ML models and integrations

### Utility Endpoints

- `POST /test-email` - Test with a sample phishing email
- `POST /send-daily-report` - Send daily security report to Slack
- `POST /send-emergency-alert` - Send emergency alert to Slack

### Example Usage

```python
import requests

# Process a suspicious email
email_content = """
From: suspicious@malicious.com
Subject: URGENT: Your account has been compromised
Date: Mon, 15 Jan 2024 10:30:00 +0000

Dear user,

Your account has been compromised. Click here to verify:
https://malicious-site.com/verify

Best regards,
Security Team
"""

response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/process-email",
    json={"email_content": email_content}
)

result = response.json()
print(f"Verdict: {result['final_analysis']['verdict']}")

   from models.content_model import phishing_detector
   
   # Generate synthetic data
   synthetic_data = phishing_detector.generate_synthetic_data(1000)
   
   # Train the model
   phishing_detector.train(synthetic_data, epochs=3)
   ```

2. **Add custom threat intelligence**:
   ```python
   from db.tidb_helpers import tidb_manager
   
   # Add known malicious indicators
   tidb_manager.add_threat_intelligence(
       ioc_type='domain',
       value='malicious.com',
       threat_level='high',
       source='manual'
   )
   ```
